## Join the discussion

If you'd like to keep up-to-date with what's going on with the BORG, follow us on Twitter [@BORG_science](https://twitter.com/BORG_science).

Our [Events page](https://boston-open-researcher-group.github.io/BORG/projects/Events/) lists the events that we are advertising. Check back periodically to see if anything interests you. If you'd like to advertise an event, we have more info [here](#advertise-an-event).

You can also watch any of our repositories by clicking on the "watch" icon in the upper right corner. Beware that you'll get emails whenever someone opens an issue or similar on a repository that you're watching. You can [edit these settings](https://github.com/settings/notifications) so that you only get notified on GitHub.

## Help out with a project

We'll list the current things we are working on under the [projects](https://github.com/Boston-Open-Researcher-Group/BORG/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aproject) label in the issues. Also check out the [help wanted](https://github.com/Boston-Open-Researcher-Group/BORG/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) label.

## Editing a repository

If you would like to contribute to any BORG repository, the easiest way to do that is to [fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), make edits and [send in a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

If you're new to Git and GitHub, we're here to help! To get in touch, you can [open an "issue"](https://github.com/Boston-Open-Researcher-Group/BORG/issues/new). Tell us a little bit about what you'd like to do, and we'll try to help you through it. In the mean time, GitHub maintains a good [list of resources](https://help.github.com/articles/git-and-github-learning-resources/) for learning how to use Git and GitHub.

If you have a suggestion, feel free to [open an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) on any BORG repository.

## Advertise an event

If you have an event that you think might be relevant to the BORG community, you have two options to add it to the website.

You can also tweet your event page [@BORG_science](https://twitter.com/BORG_science), and we can retweet it to our followers.

### Open an issue

[Open an issue](https://github.com/Boston-Open-Researcher-Group/BORG/issues/new) and tell us a little about your event. Make sure to include where and when it will take place, and a link to the registration form if you have one. We'll draft up an event post that you'll be able to see and comment on before we post it.

### Add a post yourself

Add a Markdown file describing the event to the [posts folder](https://github.com/Boston-Open-Researcher-Group/BORG/tree/master/docs/_posts). You can use [this event](https://github.com/Boston-Open-Researcher-Group/BORG/blob/master/docs/_posts/2017-12-04-Open%20Source%20Software%20Development.md) as a template. Then open a pull request, and we'll merge it.

## Run an event

If you have an idea for an event you'd like to run in the Boston area but don't know where to start, [open an issue](https://github.com/Boston-Open-Researcher-Group/BORG/issues/new) on this repository. We'll be able to point you to resources that will help you get going.
