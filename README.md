## What is the BORG?

We want to build a strong and inclusive community of open researchers in the Boston area.

Whether you're a seasoned open advocate or a newcomer to the world of open research, we want to help you develop your open research skills and connect you with [other researchers](https://boston-open-researcher-group.github.io/BORG/People/) interested in openness.

We maintain a list of [events](https://boston-open-researcher-group.github.io/BORG/projects/Events/) that may be of interest to you.

We also have [projects](https://github.com/Boston-Open-Researcher-Group/BORG/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aproject) that we're working on to help build the community.

If you'd like to get involved, take a look at our [Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/Boston-Open-Researcher-Group/BORG/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
